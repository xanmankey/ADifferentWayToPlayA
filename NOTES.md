# NOTES

- I'd like to combine the two below APIs in a C implementation (I could use the practice)
- My current idea is to manipulate the XUSB_REPORT before feeding it into vigem_target_x360_update
- I want to make it so the makefile + DWTP.c handles all of this

## ViGEm Client

- The ViGEm Client is at https://github.com/nefarius/ViGEmClient

## HIDHIDE

- The HidHide API is at https://docs.nefarius.at/projects/HidHide/API-Documentation/
